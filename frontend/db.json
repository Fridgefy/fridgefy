Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade).

You should end up with around four cups of \"cauliflower rice.\"</li><li>Heat 1T butter and 1T oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add garlic and the white and light green pieces of scallion. Sauté about a minute.</li><li>Add the cauliflower to the pan. Stir to coat with oil, then spread out in pan and let sit; you want it cook a bit and to caramelize (get a bit brown), which will bring out the sweetness. After a couple of minutes, stir and spread out again.</li><li>Add cold rice (it separates easily, so it won't clump up during cooking), plus the additional grapeseed and coconut oil or butter. Raise heat to medium-high. Toss everything together and, again, spread the mixture out over the whole pan and press a bit into the bottom. Let it sit for about two minutes—so the rice can get toasted and a little crispy. Add the peas and broccoli and stir again. Drizzle soy sauce and toasted sesame oil over rice.</li><li>Cook for another minute or so and turn off heat. Add chopped scallion tops and toss.</li><li>I like to toast some sesame seeds in a dry pan; I sprinkle these and some more raw, chopped scallion over the top of the rice for added flavor and crunch.</li><li>Season to taste with salt and, if you'd like, more soy sauce. Keep in mind that if you're serving this with something salty and saucy (ie. teriyaki chicken) you may want to hold off on adding too much salt to the fried rice.</li></ol>",

          "Size doesn't matter (when buying asparagus). Look for firm, straight stalks and an even green color. Leave limp and otherwise sad looking asparagus behind. Store in the fridge, but use within a few days.",
          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking."

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side."

Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup. Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). "

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side."

          "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets.

Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",
          "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup. Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). "

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side."

          "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
          "If you've never made quinoa before, be sure to rinse it well before you prepare it. The easiest way is to put it in a fine-mesh strainer and run water over it from the sink. Skipping this step could result in bitter, even soapy tasting quinoa because quinoa's natural coating tastes pretty bad. Quinoa sold in supermarkets is often pre-rinsed, but its better to be safe than sorry, right?",

Pinot noir's light body is great for lean cuts, medium bodied sangiovese complement meaty sauces, stews, and other multi-ingredient dishes, and full-bodied tannic malbec pairs with fatty cuts and barbecue. The Beaux Freres Willamette Valley Pinot Noir with a 4.7 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 50 dollars per bottle.",

The name \"kosher salt\" comes from the word \"koshering\", the process of making food suitable for consumption according to Jewish law. You can easily substitute table salt or sea salt in recipes where the salt is being dissolved, but if you're using it to coat meat, you might wish you had the kosher salt.",

          "The average fresh lemon contains between 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lemon juice).",

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking."

It is also important to note that the American Institute for Cancer Research has stated the consumption of ANY processed meat could increase your risk of developing cancer. Although it is not yet clear what causes the increased cancer risk, it could be the preservatives or other chemicals commonly used during processing."

Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. One wine you could try is Clos Pegase Mitsuko's Vineyard Pinot Noir. It has 4.8 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 28 dollars.",

      "instructions": "<ol><li>Begin by preheating the oven to 120C. An efficient oven is important for this dish. If the oven is too cold, the fish will not get cooked. If the oven tends to get too hot, the fish will be roasted and overcooked. If you are uncertain, then think about whether your cookies/cakes are usually overdone or underdone when you follow a recipe exactly. If they are always overdone, then you can turn down the temperature to 110C.</li><li>Get the freshest salmon fillets you can get your hands on. The thick ones are the nicest for this dish.</li><li>Add 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to the salmon fillets and rub it all over the fish.</li><li>Season generously with salt and pepper. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I usually use Masterfoods Garlic Pepper for each time that I need salt and pepper. Rub the seasonings all over the fish.</li><li>Slice two lemons into thick slices, discarding the ends. Lay the slices of lemons on a baking tray lined with baking paper.</li><li>Place the salmon fillets on top of the lemon slices. If you have left the skin on for the fillets, then make sure its skin side down.</li><li>Place the salmon fillets in the oven and cook for 25 mins. If the salmon fillets are very thick, cook a little longer for another 3 to 5 mins.</li><li>While the fish is cooking, prepare the vegetable medley and sauce.</li><li>Peel a large carrot and diagonally slice into thin slices.</li><li>Wash and pluck the leaves of a bunch of spinach. I used about 150g of baby spinach.</li><li>Heat a deep saucepan and add 1 tablespoon of cooking oil. Keep the heat at medium heat.</li><li>When the oil is hot, add 1 tablespoon of butter.</li><li>When the butter has melted, add the carrots and stir fry for a minute to cook and soften the carrots. I like them slightly crunchy so I dont cook them for too long here. Keep the heat at medium.</li><li>Remove the cooked carrot slices and set aside in a warm place.</li><li>In the same pan, add 1 tablespoon of minced garlic. Stir fry for 20 seconds.</li><li>Add the spinach leaves. Stir fry at medium heat.</li><li>Add salt and pepper to taste. About 1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper. I used Masterfoods Garlic Pepper seasonings instead again.</li><li>Stir fry the spinach till its soft and wilted. Careful not to overcook as they would lose their natural pretty green colour.</li><li>Dish up the cooked spinach and set aside in a warm place.</li><li>Now make the sauce.</li><li>Peel off the hard outer layer of 2 stalks of lemon grass. Slice into 2 inch long pieces and using the back of your knife, bash the lemongrass and bruise the slightly for the fragrance and flavours to emit.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of butter to a small saucepan.</li><li>When the butter has melted and is bubbling slightly, add the lemongrass. Cook at medium heat for 30 seconds.</li><li>Add 150ml of fresh liquid cream. Let the mixture come to a gentle rolling boil.</li><li>Add 1 teaspoon of liquid chicken stock concentrate. Or you can use 1/2 cube of chicken stock bouillon. Stir it in well, and do a taste check. If its not salty enough, add more chicken stock.</li><li>Whisk the sauce as it boils and thickens.</li><li>After a couple of minutes, the sauce would have thickened. Remove the lemongrass.</li><li>Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. I usually use a strainer and squeeze a lemon directly over the sauce. Do a taste check. Add more lemon juice if necessary. Whisk well to combine.</li><li>The salmon should be done by now. Remove them from the oven.</li><li>Plate your dish but placing some spinach and carrots at the bottom of a plate or shallow dish.</li><li>Gently place the salmon fillet on top. Drizzle a generous amount of sauce around the fish. Garnish with chives.</li></ol>",

          "Butter's incredible flavor has made it an extremely popular cooking fat, but it is important to know that butter has the lowest smoke point of almost any cooking fat. This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. So while butter is great for cooking at lower temperatures, you should probably use canola oil, coconut oil, or  <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">another oil with a higher smoke point</a> for frying and other high temperature cooking.",
          "Confused by the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cream\">different types of cream</a> &mdash; Most differences arise from the fat content of the cream, and whether or not the cream has been \"soured\" by adding lactic acid bacteria to give it a tangy flavor.",
          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "The average fresh lemon contains between 2 to 3 tablespoons of lemon juice (just in case you are substituting bottled lemon juice).",
          "Carrots can be stored in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. The starch in the carrots will turn to sugar over time, but this is not a problem, they'll just taste sweeter. The academy lesson about <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/carrots\">carrots</a> contains more useful information.",
          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking."

Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir.

          "To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.",
          "Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.",
          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier.",
          "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
          "Don't have fresh herbs? Substitute dried herbs, but use about 1/3 less because dried herbs are more potent than fresh.  ",
          "You should not store your onions with your potatoes because the gases they emit will make each other spoil faster. For more information about selecting and storing onions, check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/onions\">this lesson about onions</a> in the academy."

          "Tomatoes, especially cherry tomatoes, should be bought <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php\">organic</a> when possible. Moreover, buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much, much tastier, not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!",
          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",
          "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",

One wine you could try is Beaux Freres Willamette Valley Pinot Noir. It has 4.7 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 50 dollars.",

However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking."

Reviewers quite like it with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 20 dollars per bottle.",

To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!"

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking."

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade).

Adjust the salt to taste.\nBring everything back to the boiling point and simmer for another hour.  After this point, you can turn your burner to its lowest setting, and this soup will happily sit steaming with its lid cocked for several hours until you are ready to enjoy it.  Add more water if necessary.\nServe with crusty bread and a soft cheese like St. Andre or Cambazola",

A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. The Etude Heirloom Pinot Noir with a 5 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 89 dollars per bottle.",

          "With feta cheese, a little goes a long way, so you probably don't need to worry about using low fat varieties (plus, research suggests people who eat full fat dairy <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thesalt/2014/02/12/275376259/the-full-fat-paradox-whole-milk-may-keep-us-lean\">are thinner</a> than those who eat reduced fat products!)",
          "Here is an easy health swap: substitute brown rice for white rice. Brown rice is a whole grain, while white rice is brown rice stripped of some of its parts and much of its fiber and other nutrients. It is important to note, however, that all rice types raise your <a href=\"http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsweek/Glycemic_index_and_glycemic_load_for_100_foods.htm\">blood sugar</a> and should be eaten in moderation. In fact, if it seems like it would work in the recipe, the best option would probably be so-called <a href=\"http://spoonacular.com/Another-(simpler)-Version-Of-Cauliflower-Rice-30679\">cauliflower rice</a>.",
          "If you are cooking with wine, be aware that the amount of alcohol that evaporates could be much less than you think. In fact, <a href=\"http://old.post-gazette.com/magazine/19980903alcohol8.asp\">researchers found</a> that anywhere between 4 and 49 percent of the alcohol in a dish might remain depending on the cooking method, length of cooking, etc. If you're concerned about the amount of alcohol you're consuming, keep an eye on how much wine is going into your dish!",
          "Lycopene, the chemical in tomatoes that makes them red (and healthy), is fat soluble. This means eating tomatoes with a <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> &mdash; say, avocado or olive oil?improves the body's ability to absorb the lycopene. Don't hesitate to include some healthy fats in this dish to get the most health benefits from the tomatoes!",
          "Unfortunately feta cheese is high in sodium, so if you're watching your sodium intake you might need to substitute another cheese. Some say rinsing the cheese also reduces its sodium content."

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."

          "When buying wine for cooking, it is certainly not a bad idea to buy a wine you would enjoy drinking (some wine for the dish, some wine for the chef?) But if your favorite wines cost a small fortune, save them for drinking and purchase a cheaper?though still good quality!?wine for cooking. Just don't buy \"cooking wine\" with added salt, food coloring, etc. ",
          "To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.",
          "Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.",
          "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
          "Don't have any wine in the house? Red wine vinegar and white wine vinegar can be used to deglaze pans. Chicken/beef broth or grape juice can also be used in place of wine in a pinch, especially if a recipe only calls for a small amount.",
          "You should not store your onions with your potatoes because the gases they emit will make each other spoil faster. For more information about selecting and storing onions, check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/onions\">this lesson about onions</a> in the academy.",
          "Traditionally, feta cheese is made from sheep's or goat's milk (or a combination of the two). Now some supermarkets sell \"feta-style\" cheeses made from cow's milk. If you want the authentic feta experience, be sure to read the label carefully."

          "Tomatoes, especially cherry tomatoes, should be bought <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php\">organic</a> when possible. Moreover, buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much, much tastier, not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",

          "Yogurt is a good source of probiotics, \"good\" bacteria that contribute to intestinal health and can improve digestion. Look at the label on your yogurt and make sure it says it contains \"live and active cultures.\" ",
          "Before you pass up garlic because you don't want the bad breath that comes with it, keep in mind that the compounds that cause garlic breath also offer a lot of health benefits. Garlic has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).",
          "Lycopene, the chemical in tomatoes that makes them red (and healthy), is fat soluble. This means eating tomatoes with a <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> &mdash; say, avocado or olive oil?improves the body's ability to absorb the lycopene. Don't hesitate to include some healthy fats in this dish to get the most health benefits from the tomatoes!",
          "Unfortunately feta cheese is high in sodium, so if you're watching your sodium intake you might need to substitute another cheese. Some say rinsing the cheese also reduces its sodium content.",
          "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

          "Most dairy products stay good well past their sell-by date. Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."

          "Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.",
          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier.",
          "Don't have fresh herbs? Substitute dried herbs, but use about 1/3 less because dried herbs are more potent than fresh.  ",

          "Traditionally, feta cheese is made from sheep's or goat's milk (or a combination of the two). Now some supermarkets sell \"feta-style\" cheeses made from cow's milk. If you want the authentic feta experience, be sure to read the label carefully."

Moreover, buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much, much tastier, not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

          "Many people will tell you to remove the skin on your chicken to cut down on fat. This is true, but if you like the taste, leave it on! You're only gaining a little fat for a lot of flavor. Plus, a little over half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsatured fat (that's a heart-healthy kind) and the notion that saturated fat is unhealthy is being <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Saturated-fats-and-heart-disease-link-unproven.aspx\">questioned</a> too. So in our opinion: dig in, skin and all!",

The calories and the <a href=\"http://www.quickanddirtytips.com/health-fitness/healthy-eating/truth-about-whole-grains?page=all\">effect on your blood sugar</a> is not so drastically different! ",
          "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",

Plus, a little over half of the fat in chicken skin is monounsatured fat (that's a heart-healthy kind) and the notion that saturated fat is unhealthy is being <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/news/2014/03March/Pages/Saturated-fats-and-heart-disease-link-unproven.aspx\">questioned</a> too. So in our opinion: dig in, skin and all!",

Garlic has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral properties. If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).",

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."

          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

This means eating tomatoes with a <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> &mdash; say, avocado or olive oil?improves the body's ability to absorb the lycopene. Don't hesitate to include some healthy fats in this dish to get the most health benefits from the tomatoes!",

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."

        "cooking": [
          "You do not have to remove the seeds from a cucumber. In fact, the seeds are probably the most nutritious part! As for the skin, you should probably peel cucumbers (unless you like the skin and know the cucumber has not been waxed).",
          "To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.",
          "You should not store your onions with your potatoes because the gases they emit will make each other spoil faster. For more information about selecting and storing onions, check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/onions\">this lesson about onions</a> in the academy.",
          "Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.",
          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",
          "Traditionally, feta cheese is made from sheep's or goat's milk (or a combination of the two). Now some supermarkets sell \"feta-style\" cheeses made from cow's milk. If you want the authentic feta experience, be sure to read the label carefully."

          "Tomatoes, especially cherry tomatoes, should be bought <a href=\"http://www.ewg.org/foodnews/list.php\">organic</a> when possible. Moreover, buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much, much tastier, not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

The Marcassin Marcassin Vineyard Pinot Noir with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 315 dollars per bottle.",

      "instructions": "<ol><li>To Make the pork shoulder:</li><li>Place all ingredients in the crock pot.  Cook for 5 hours on low.  Meat should be tender and easily shred when finished cooking.</li><li>To Make the Chipotle Greek Yogurt:</li><li>In a small bowl, add the Greek yogurt.  Crack open your can of chipotle chilies in adobo sauce and remove the seeds from 3 or 4 of the chilies (about half of the can). Finely chop and add to the Greek yogurt.

          "Sea salt is not healthier than table salt, contrary to what you may have heard. Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",

The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices.",

          "You can easily swap half of the white flour in most recipes for whole wheat flour to add some fiber and protein. It does result in a heavier dough, so for cookies, cakes, etc., you might try swapping in whole wheat pastry flour.",
          "Depending on the recipe, you might be able to substitute almond meal or flaxseed for the breadcrumbs to reduce the carbohydrate content and up the nutrition. For example, almond meal works well for breading, while ground flaxseed can help with binding.",

          "Egg yolks are high in cholesterol, leading some people to recommend eating only egg whites or limiting egg consumption to one egg per day. However, new research suggests you might go ahead and eat your whole eggs. It turns out egg yolk contains valuable nutrients (the cartenoids that make it yellow are great for eye health, folic acid is great for brain health, and it has vitamins A, E, D, and K) and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cholesterol\">dietary cholesterol</a> seems to have little influence on blood cholesterol levels.",

If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).",

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny.

So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup.

This means butter literally starts to smoke at a lower temperature than most other fats between 250-350 degrees Fahrenheit. So while butter is great for cooking at lower temperatures, you should probably use canola oil, coconut oil, or  <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">another oil with a higher smoke point</a> for frying and other high temperature cooking.",
          "To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.",
          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "Make sure you cook ground meat thoroughly. Grinding meat creates a lot of surface area that bacteria can grow on, so eating undercooked ground meat poses a real health risk.",
          "If you're using olive oil to cook at high temperatures, make sure that the olive oil you're using has a high smoke point because heating an oil past its smoke point can ruin the flavor and even release harmful compounds into your dish. Many people recommend saving extra-virgin olive oil for cold dishes or for adding the finishing touch to a warm dish. You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side.",
          "You should not store your onions with your potatoes because the gases they emit will make each other spoil faster. For more information about selecting and storing onions, check out <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/onions\">this lesson about onions</a> in the academy.",

          "You might have heard that you should never wash mushrooms. Before you spend your precious time wiping down mushroom after mushroom with a towel, you should probably know that this is mostly a myth. While mushrooms can absorb a little water if you soak them long enough, the amount absorbed from a quick wash is not going to have much of an impact on your dish.",
          "To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.",
          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "Carrots can be stored in the fridge for 2 to 3 weeks. The starch in the carrots will turn to sugar over time, but this is not a problem, they'll just taste sweeter. The academy lesson about <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/carrots\">carrots</a> contains more useful information.",
          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!"

Red berry fruits, tart cranberry, raspberry, and spices coat the palette, finishing with juicy acidity.

This wine has been barreled for 20 months in French oak, and has warm toasty aromas weaved throughout.",

If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!",

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off."

If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

          "Just a head's up: tomatoes shouldn't be refrigerated! They will lose their flavor and probably get mushy too. For more on selecting and storing tomatoes and other vegetables, check out the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy#Ingredients\">academy</a>.",
          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

The aromas have amazing perfumed notes typical of fine Pinot Noir and this one expresses ripe cherry and wild raspberry notes with truffle, clove and star anise spices. The palate has ample acidity and brilliant balance due to grapes picked at ripeness; not over-ripe. These notes are expressed as ripe cherry and cherry vanilla, a sappy core of French oak, vanilla and mocha which appear very silky on the palate and finish.",

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",
          "Confused by the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cream\">different types of cream</a> &mdash; Most differences arise from the fat content of the cream, and whether or not the cream has been \"soured\" by adding lactic acid bacteria to give it a tangy flavor."

      "instructions": "In a large bowl, allow corn husks to soak in hot water. In a large saucepan, bring 4 cups of water to a boil. Remove any string-like particles from the chili pods. Add them to the boiling water along with half of a packet of Goya seasoning. Cover and let boil for about 20 minutes.\nAfterwards, place chili pods with 2 cups of the stock in a blender to coalesce. Drain the saucepan of the remaining stock and place back on the stove top. Return the heat to medium, and add olive oil once the remaining stock evaporates.\nAdd onion and beef, and immediately begin to break apart the beef. Add 1 packet of Goya seasoning and chili powder, and allow to cook for 5 minutes. Add the chili sauce and cook an additional 5 minutes. Add garlic and 2 teaspoon salt. I added the poblano pepper at this point, but I should have added it with the beef and onion.\nReduce heat to medium-low, and cook for one hour. For the last twenty minutes, partially cover the pan in order to slightly reduce. Most of the liquid should be reduced and thickened.\nIn a large bowl, add instant corn masa mix, water, baking powder, salt, and olive oil to create corn masa mix. The mixture should be spongy.\nWhats surprisingly tricky is assembling the tamales. The best technique Ive found is to thinly spread the tamale masa mix starting from the right-hand side of the corn husks, and leaving about 2 inches on the left-hand side of the husk. When rolling the tamale together, take the right-hand side and fold it onto the rest of the corn husk covered with tamale masa mix. The 1-2 inches left over should roll perfectly over the actual tamale. Dont overstuff the tamales! Id say 2 tablespoon of meat mixture and just a sparse amount of cheese.\nO cook, you should have a double boiler. If you dont, like me, then use a metal colander and place it in a large pot. Place the tamales in the colander (or double boiler) where they are not squished, nor are they loose enough to unravel themselves. While doing this, boil 2 cups of water in the pot or what equates to 1 inch in height of the water.\nOnce water comes to a boil, reduce heat and add the tamales. Place a towel between the colander and lid, and cook for 30 minutes.",

The best technique Ive found is to thinly spread the tamale masa mix starting from the right-hand side of the corn husks, and leaving about 2 inches on the left-hand side of the husk. When rolling the tamale together, take the right-hand side and fold it onto the rest of the corn husk covered with tamale masa mix. The 1-2 inches left over should roll perfectly over the actual tamale. Dont overstuff the tamales! Id say 2 tablespoon of meat mixture and just a sparse amount of cheese.",

Quinoa sold in supermarkets is often pre-rinsed, but its better to be safe than sorry, right?",

If it's almost smooshy, it's too ripe. The perfect avocado can be hard to find in stores, so you might have to buy your avocados in advance and ripen them at home. To speed up the ripening process, put the avocados in a paper bag with an apple or banana. It really works!",

Instead of throwing out perfectly safe food that is just a few days or maybe even a week or two old, make sure the product smells fine, has a normal texture, and doesn't taste funny. Sniff testing isn't exactly rocket science and it can keep you from wasting food (and money)."

          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",
          "To prevent curdling, take sour cream of the fridge well in advance and only add it to hot soups or sauces once it has reached room temperature and once the soup/sauce has cooled down a bit.",
          "Confused by the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/cream\">different types of cream</a> &mdash; Most differences arise from the fat content of the cream, and whether or not the cream has been \"soured\" by adding lactic acid bacteria to give it a tangy flavor."

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off."

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off."

Reviewers quite like it with a 4 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 12 dollars per bottle.",

If you really want to get the most health benefits out of your garlic, choose Spanish garlic, which contains the most allicin (one of garlic's most beneficial compounds).",
          "Sea salt is not healthier than table salt, contrary to what you may have heard. Sea salt is usually 97.5% sodium chloride (same as regular old table salt) and the minerals accounting for the rest are too insignificant to make a difference?unless you plan on consuming sea salt by the pound, in which case the health benefits from the minerals will definitely be outweighed by the negative effects of all the sodium you are consuming!",

This means eating tomatoes with a <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/fat\">fat</a> &mdash; say, avocado or olive oil?improves the body's ability to absorb the lycopene. Don't hesitate to include some healthy fats in this dish to get the most health benefits from the tomatoes!",
          "Although the body needs salt to survive, most of us get too much. The problem with consuming too much salt (what chemists call \"sodium chloride\") is actually the <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/sodium\">sodium</a> part, which is why people concerned about high blood pressure go on low-sodium diets. If you are trying to reduce salt in your diet, you can try salt substitutes like potassium chloride or try to make do with less salt by using more black pepper, herbs, and spices."

So if you have expensive sea salt, save it for sprinkling on salads or dark chocolate cookies, don't try to use it in your pasta sauce or soup. Once sea salt dissolves, the flavor is indistinguishable from table salt from the shaker (after all, they are chemically the same thing, sodium chloride). ",

          "To keep your eyes from stinging and watering while cutting onions, trying popping the onion in the freezer for 15 minutes before you plan to start cooking. Chilling the onion slows the release of the enzyme responsible for teary eyes.",
          "Here's a trick for peeling garlic quickly. Put the garlic clove on your cutting board. Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",
          "Fresh herbs should be added toward the end of the cooking process &mdash; even at the very last minute?especially delicate herbs like cilantro, basil, and dill. Hardier herbs like bay leaves, rosemary, and thyme can be added earlier.",
          "Extra-virgin olive oil is the least refined type of olive oil and therefore contains more of the beneficial compounds that get lost during processing. However, its minimal processing could also mean it has a lower smoke point than other olive oils. Once an oil starts to smoke, it begins to break down, producing a bad flavor and potentially harmful compounds. Unfortunately, the smoke point of an oil depends on so many factors that it is hard to say what the smoke point of an oil really is. For extra-virgin olive oil, it could be anywhere between 200-400 degrees Fahrenheit. Most people recommend using extra-virgin olive oil to add flavor to a finished dish or in cold dishes to be on the safe side. More refined olive oils, canola oil,  coconut oil, and <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/butter\">clarified butter/ghee</a> are better options for high temperature cooking.",

Moreover, buying tomatoes from your <a href=\"http://www.localharvest.org/farmers-markets/\">local farmers' market</a> when they are in season is going to make your dish much, much tastier, not to mention more eco-friendly. In fact, we recommend using canned &mdash; or better yet, jarred?tomato products when tomatoes aren't in season instead of buying imported or greenhouse-grown tomatoes."

Take a knife with a thick blade and place the blade flat across the garlic clove (the clove should be closer to the handle than the middle of the blade). Whack down on the flat side of the blade with your free hand to smoosh the garlic a bit. Done correctly, the skin will peel right off.",

You could also use canola oil, coconut oil, or another good <a href=\"https://spoonacular.com/academy/vegetable-oil\">high-temperature oil</a> to be on the safe side."
